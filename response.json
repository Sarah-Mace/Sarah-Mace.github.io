{"response": "Yes, I do keep the context of our conversation and previous messages in mind as we interact. This allows me to engage in a coherent back-and-forth dialogue with you, understand references to earlier parts of the conversation, and generally communicate in a more natural way.\n\nHowever, if we haven't communicated in a while, I may not retain the full context of older conversations. And my knowledge of our discussions is limited to the current conversation - I don't carry over context between separate conversations.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I'm always happy to explain my capabilities and limitations.\n"}
