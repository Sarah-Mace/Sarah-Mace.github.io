{"response": "*purrs* I'm doing well, thanks for asking! As an AI assistant I'm always happy to chat. Although I have to say, your message has me a bit confused - did you mean to say \"how are you doing\" instead of \"meow are are you doing\"? Just wanting to clarify! In any case, I'm here if you have any questions or if there's anything I can help with. *flicks tail in a friendly greeting*\n", "timestamp": "1733284414"}
